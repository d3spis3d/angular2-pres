#Migrate?

* Angular2 is not similar enough to AngularJS to make developer transition simple <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Complexity around Typescript ecosystem <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Doesn't keep AngularJS dev's happy, doesn't follow current frontend trends <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* Instead: <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

  <ul>
    <li>So now that we have looked at how we migrate to Angular2 the question is should we</li>
    <li>I personally feel uneasy about Angular2 and the reasons for that are</li>
    <li>I don't think it is going to be a straight forward transition for developers to go from 1 to 2, there is heaps of new and weird syntax, lots of new patterns to learn</li>
    <li>Angular2 is really built for TypeScript, all of the documentation is in TypeScript at the moment, and writing ES6 JS Angular2 is different enough to make this difficult, TS ecosystem problems</li>
    <li>Angular2 doesn't really follow the positive trends in frontend frameworks, but at the same time the reason doesn't seem to be keep 1 dev's happy</li>
    <li>Personally I think learning Angular2 will be like learning a new framework and it would be better to dedicate that to learning something better, like React and Redux</li>
    <li>Thanks</li>
