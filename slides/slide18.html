    <ul>
        <li>Handle most of the business logic of Angular2 apps</li>
        <li class="fragment">Communicate with the backend to load/store data</li>
        <li class="fragment">Much the same of AngularJS services</li>

        <ul>
            <li>As I mention before Services are where almost of of our business logic lies in Angular2</li>
            <li>Much the same as AngularJS they also handle the sending and receiving data from the server</li>
            <li>Almost exactly the same as AngularJS services in design except they are classes</li>
