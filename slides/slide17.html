            <li>So now that we have seen how data binding works we can look at communication between Components</li>
            <li>Angular2 provides the EventEmitter class that we can use to pass data up from our child Components to their parents</li>
            <li>Here we have a VoterComponent, which is our child Component and it has defined using decorators input and outputs</li>
            <li>It uses the EventEmitter to emit a vote event when its child button elements are clicked</li>
            <li>It received data from the click handler of the button, and passes data up to its parent</li>
