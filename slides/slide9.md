# TypeScript

- Angular2 uses TypeScript, a compile to JS language from Microsoft
- Can use ES6, or plain JS <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Angular2 in plain JS looks a bit too much like Backebone.js <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Documentation is currently in TypeScript <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

  <ul>
    <li>Angular2 is built with, and recommended to be written in, TypeScript a compile to JS language</li>
    <li>TypeScript looks similar to Java, and provides static typing, interfaces, classes</li>
    <li>Angular2 can still be written in ES6 or plain JS, the only problems are that</li>
    <li>Looks too much like Backbone in plain JS, although ES6 is mostly good</li>
    <li>At this stage almost all of the documentation is in TypeScript and the large differences between TS and ES6 make it hard to work in ES6</li>
  </ul>
