# Components

- Take the role of Controller + View
- Controller and the View are more tightly coupled in Components <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- Angular2 encourages us to push most of our logic out of the Controller and into Services <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
