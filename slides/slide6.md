# Angular2?

Angular2 sits somewhere in the middle

* Hasn't gotten on the functional, immutable bandwagon <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Has taken on a component based view approach <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Originally announced with one-way data binding <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* Since added two-way data binding <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

  <ul>
    <li>Angular2 hasn't entirely followed this trend and sits somewhere in the middle</li>
    <li>No functional approach, but has adopted the component based view approach of React.js</li>
    <li>Originally announced with only one-way binding, but after much community uproar added opt-in two-way</li>
    <li>Developer if they so choose can stick with mutable state and end up back at the previous diagram</li>
  </ul>
