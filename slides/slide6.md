# Angular2?

Angular2 sits somewhere in the middle

* Hasn't gotten on the functional, immutable bandwagon <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Has taken on a component based view approach <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
* Originally announced with one-way data binding <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
* Since added two-way data binding <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
